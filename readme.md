**About MySkin web app**
This web application is designed for skincare enthusiasts who want to keep track of their skincare routine, monitor the expiry dates of their products and track which products work for you. Skincare products can be daunting, confusing and difficult to measure effectiveness. Myskin tackles these challenges headon with an easy to use and accessible web application. You can now easily track which products work for you and which products break you out, ultimately saving you money and time!

The web app allows you to create an account where you can build a customized routine that caters to your skincare needs and track the products you use. Users can easily swap products in their routine at anytime and easily track their skin reactions to a product. As an added feature, the app allows users to set reminders for when to repurchase products or when to throw them out after they have expired. This ensures that users are always using fresh, effective products that are safe for their skin.

Overall, MySkin is an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their skincare routine, discover new products, and achieve healthy, glowing skin.
